# Texas Anglers App

### Project Proposal

The app will use the open source Map API to show locations of lakes and rivers, [Map API](https://www.openstreetmap.org/). [Weather API](https://www.weatherapi.com/) will be used to show what the weather will be like at the location. Users will be able to create accounts, add information about fishing locations and share what there experience was at the specific loation. Data will be scraped to get infomation about fishing, best locations, fishing guides and more.

## Goals

1. Allow users to be able create account to view infomation about fishing locations in their area or where they are travelling to.
2. Users can post the type of fish they caught and other information about that fishing trip.
3. There will be charts/graphs to show the type of fish caught, bait used, time of day, and weather conditions.
